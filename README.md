### Hi there 👋
- ☠️ I wrote my first line of code three years ago! 
-  :chart_with_upwards_trend: Most of these projects reflect my historical journey in code. 
-  :grinning:Some of the coolest stuff here were projects I did with my classmates at a data analytics bootcamp. 
-  :full_moon_with_face: I'm working on updating github with current projects that reflect what my code looks like at present. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate (for fun and learning) on academic research, analytics and digital humanities projects. 
- :pizza: Python, SQL(newish!) and Julia( new!) are my jam.
- :rocket: I'm looking for a new postion as a data analyst. I'm creative, smart, funny and a pretty nice person. I'd make a great addtion to the right team.
